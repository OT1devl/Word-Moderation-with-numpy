### üìú **About the Repository**
This repository contains an implementation of a classical neural network with embedding to classify words as either "good" or "bad" based on character-level analysis. The neural network is built from scratch using only Python and NumPy. The goal of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of how embedding layers work and to explore neural networks at the character level, without relying on high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

### ‚ö° **Features**
- Character-level classification of words as "good" or "bad"
- Uses a simple neural network architecture with an embedding layer
- Built with Python and NumPy (no high-level libraries)
- Easy to understand and modify for learning purposes
